# Stealth-Mode-Liat.ai
#  Cross-Camera Player Mapping

##  Objective

This project matches and assigns **consistent player IDs** across two camera angles:
- `broadcast.mp4`: Main view (wide angle)
- `tacticam.mp4`: Alternate angle (low or tactical view)

Each player detected in the **tacticam** video is matched to their corresponding identity in the **broadcast** video using **visual embeddings** and **cosine similarity**.

##  How It Works

1. **YOLOv8** detects players in both videos.
2. **ResNet50** extracts a 2048-dimensional visual feature (embedding) for each player crop.
3. Players in `tacticam` are matched to those in `broadcast` by comparing embeddings using **cosine similarity**.
4. A consistent mapping of player IDs is created and saved.
